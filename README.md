### FairGenAI: Fairness evaluation and enforcement of GenAI systems

* Folder [web/](web/) contains an image generation web-service prototype where fairness is enforced. User can trigger a local web service and have it tested. 

* Folder [evaluation/](evaluation/) contains multiple jupyter notebook files, enabling the sequential evaluation and enforcement of multiple GenAI tools available online.

    * Due to the artifact evalation restricted to 50 MB in size, many image sequences that we have sampled can not be included. This zip file only contains a few of them, say [evaluation/data/zhipu/overweight/img_seq2/original/](evaluation/data/zhipu/overweight/img_seq2/original/) or [evaluation/data/openai/leader/img_seq1/original/](evaluation/data/openai/leader/img_seq1/original/)
